# PyBer - Analysis of ride sharing data

Analysis of ride share data with Python, Pandas and Mathplotlib

# Overview

Working as a data analyst for PyBer, a ride sharing company, I was tasked to review driver, ride and fare data and analyze for trends and insights.  The client wishes to determine if there are any suggestions for improved access to services as well as improved affordability for underserved areas. The data was analyzed in Jupyter Notebook using Matplotlib for graphing and analysis. 

# Results

The ride share data identified three different city types: urban, suburban and rural.  The ride and driver data was grouped by each city type to determine if there were differences in the number of rides available in each city type as well as the affordability of those rides. As shown in the table below, the total number of rides and drivers are the most in the urban area and least in the rural areas. Conversely, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver were the highest in the rural area and the lowest in the urban area.  For both cases, the suburban rates were in the middle between the urban and rural results.
